# **Step 1: Install Rasa**
#
# First, you'll need to install Rasa.  It's highly recommended to do this in a virtual environment to keep your project dependencies isolated.
#
# **Step 1.1: Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**
#
# Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project. Then, run the following commands:
#
# ```bash
# python -m venv .venv  # Create a virtual environment named ".venv"
# source .venv/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment (Linux/macOS)
# .\.venv\Scripts\activate  # Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
# ```
#
# **Step 1.2: Install Rasa Open Source**
#
# With your virtual environment activated, install Rasa using pip:
#
# ```bash
# pip install rasa
# ```
#
# **Step 2: Initialize a Rasa Project**
#
# Once Rasa is installed, you can create a new project using the `rasa init` command. This will set up the basic project structure and generate some starter files.
#
# ```bash
# rasa init --no-prompt # Use --no-prompt for non-interactive init
# ```
#
# This will create a directory with the following structure:
#
# ```
# ├── actions.py          # Python code for custom actions
# ├── config.yml         # Configuration file for your Rasa bot
# ├── data
# │   ├── nlu.md          # Training data for Natural Language Understanding (NLU)
# │   └── stories.md      # Training data for dialogue flows (stories)
# ├── domain.yml         # Defines the bot's domain (intents, entities, slots, responses, actions)
# └── models            # Where trained models are stored
# ```
#
# **Step 3: Define Intents and Entities in `nlu.md`**
#
# Now, let's define the intents and entities that our chatbot needs to understand log queries. Open the `data/nlu.md` file and add the following:
#
```markdown
version: "3.1"
nlu:
- intent: greet
  examples: |
    - hey

    - compare logs
    - compare logs of {app_name} and {app_name_2}

- intent: get_status
  examples: |
    - what is the status of app {app_name}
    - show status of {app_name}
    - application status
    - status of application {app_name}

    - escalate

```
#
# We've defined several intents here:
# * `greet`, `goodbye`: Standard greeting and farewell intents.
# * `show_logs`, `filter_logs`: Intents for retrieving and filtering logs.  Note the use of curly braces `{}` to define entities like `app_name`, `transaction_id`, `start_time`, and `end_time`.
# * `find_errors`, `filter_errors`: Intents to find and filter errors.
# * `summarize_logs`: Intent to summarize logs.
# * `compare_logs`: Intent to compare logs
# * `get_status`: Intent to get the status of an application
# * `get_help`: Intent to get help.
# * `escalate`: Intent to escalate.
#
# **Step 4: Define the Domain in `domain.yml`**
#
# The `domain.yml` file defines the bot's universe, including intents, entities, slots, responses, and actions.  Open `domain.yml` and add the following:
#
```yaml
version: "3.1"

intents:
  - greet
  - goodbye
  - show_logs
  - filter_logs
  - find_errors
  - filter_errors
  - summarize_logs
  - compare_logs
  - get_status
  - get_help
  - escalate

entities:
  - app_name
  - transaction_id
  - start_time
  - end_time
  - app_name_2 #for compare logs
  - start_time_2 #for compare logs
  - end_time_2 #for compare logs

slots:
  app_name:
    type: text
    influence_conversation: true
  transaction_id:
    type: text
    influence_conversation: true
  start_time:
    type: text
    influence_conversation: true
  end_time:
    type: text
    influence_conversation: true
  app_name_2: #for compare logs
    type: text
    influence_conversation: true
  start_time_2: #for compare logs
    type: text
    influence_conversation: true
  end_time_2: #for compare logs
    type: text
    influence_conversation: true

responses:
  utter_greet:
  - text: "Hello! How can I help you with your logs today?"

  utter_goodbye:
  - text: "Goodbye!"

  utter_no_logs_found:
  - text: "Sorry, I couldn't find any logs matching your criteria."

  utter_error_generic:
  - text: "I encountered an error while processing your request. Please try again."

  utter_summarize_logs:
    - text: "Okay, I am summarizing the logs for you"

  utter_compare_logs:
    - text: "Okay, I am comparing the logs"

  utter_get_status:
    - text: "Okay, I am fetching the application status for you."

  utter_help:
    - text: "I can help you with log analysis. You can ask me to show logs, filter logs by application, transaction ID, or time range, find errors, summarize logs, compare logs, and get the application status."

  utter_escalate:
    - text: "I'm connecting you to a human agent."

actions:
  - action_query_logs
  - action_find_errors
  - action_summarize_logs
  - action_compare_logs
  - action_get_status
  - action_escalate
  - action_get_help # Add this action
```
#
# We've defined:
# * `intents`:  The intents we defined in `nlu.md`.
# * `entities`: The entities we defined in `nlu.md`.
# * `slots`:  Slots are like variables that hold the values of the entities extracted from the user's input.  For example, the `app_name` slot will hold the value of the `app_name` entity.  `influence_conversation: true` helps Rasa to remember these values.
# * `responses`:  Canned responses the bot can use.
# * `actions`:  Custom actions (defined in `actions.py`) that the bot will execute.  Crucially, we have `action_query_logs` to handle the log querying.
#
# **Step 5: Define Dialogue Flows (Stories) in `data/stories.md`**
#
# Stories define the paths of conversation between the user and the bot.  Open `data/stories.md` and add the following:
#
```markdown
version: "3.1"

  - intent: greet

```
#
# We've defined several stories that cover different conversation flows:
# * Basic greetings and goodbyes.
# * Stories for showing and filtering logs, demonstrating how the bot handles different combinations of entities.
# * Stories for showing and filtering errors.
# * Stories for summarizing and comparing logs.
# * Story to get application status
# * Story to get help
# * Story to escalate
#
# **Step 6: Create Custom Actions in `actions.py`**
#
# Now, let's create the custom actions that will interact with your log analysis system.  Open the `actions.py` file.  You'll need to implement the logic to query your Splunk API (or whatever system you're using to store logs) here.  I'll provide a template, but you'll need to fill in the specifics of your environment.
#
```python

#
# **Key Points:**
# * Each action class inherits from `Action`.
# * The `name()` method returns the name of the action (which must match the name in `domain.yml`).
# * The `run()` method is where the action's logic is implemented.  It takes three arguments:
#     * `dispatcher`: Used to send messages back to the user.
#     * `tracker`:  Used to access the current state of the conversation (including slots).
#     * `domain`:  The bot's domain.
# * We use `tracker.get_slot()` to retrieve the values of the entities extracted from the user's input.
# * **Crucially, you'll need to replace the placeholder code for querying Splunk with your actual Splunk API calls.** Use the Splunk SDK for Python (`splunklib`) or another appropriate library.  You'll need to construct the correct Splunk Query Language (SPL) queries based on the extracted entities.
# * The actions use `dispatcher.utter_message()` to send the query results or other responses to the user.  The results are formatted as JSON for easy parsing.
# * Slots are cleared after use.
# * Error handling is included.
#
# **Step 7: Train the Rasa Model**
#
# Now that you've defined your NLU data, domain, stories, and actions, you need to train the Rasa model.  Run the following command in your terminal:
#
# ```bash
# rasa train
# ```
#
# This command will train the NLU model and the dialogue management model and save them in the `models` directory.
#
# **Step 8: Test the Chatbot**
#
# Once the model is trained, you can test it using the `rasa shell` command:
#
# ```bash
# rasa shell
# ```
#
# This will start a command-line interface where you can chat with your bot.  Try entering some log queries and see how the bot responds.  For example:
#
# * "Show me logs for app payment"
# * "Show me logs from 2024-01-01 to 2024-01-03"
# * "What is the status of app auth"
#
# **Step 9: Connect to a Chat Interface (Optional)**
#
# To make your chatbot accessible to users, you'll need to connect it to a chat interface, such as a web application, Slack, or another messaging platform.  Rasa provides several ways to do this:
# * **Rasa Webchat:** A simple web chat widget that you can embed in your website.
# * **Rasa REST API:** A REST API that allows you to connect your chatbot to any chat interface.
# * **Rasa connectors:** Integrations with various messaging platforms like Slack, Facebook Messenger, and more.
#
# The specific steps for connecting to a chat interface will depend on the platform you choose.  Refer to the Rasa documentation for detailed instructions: [https://rasa.com/docs/rasa](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa)
#
# **Important Considerations for Production**
#
# * **Splunk Authentication:** In a production environment, you'll need to handle Splunk authentication securely (e.g., using API keys, not hardcoding credentials).
# * **Error Handling and Logging:** Implement robust error handling and logging to track errors and debug issues.
# * **Scalability:** Consider the scalability of your Rasa deployment and your Splunk infrastructure to handle a large volume of user queries.
# * **Security:** Ensure that your chatbot and your log analysis system are secure and protect sensitive data.
# * **NLU Performance:** Continuously monitor the performance of your NLU model and retrain it with new data as needed to maintain accuracy.
#
# Let me know if you have any questions or would like to dive deeper into any of these steps.
